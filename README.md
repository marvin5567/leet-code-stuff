# leet-code-stuff
good place to keep track of my leet code progress since i need to get on that grind ðŸ’ªðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

if you're seeing this then hi this folder wont be filled with inherently the most insane leetcode submissions; but more or less a place for me to keep track of how i think/how im doing in terms of code

*also to keep me fresh*
